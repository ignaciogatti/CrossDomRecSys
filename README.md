# CrossDomRecSys
![Cross Domain Approach ](https://github.com/ignaciogatti/CrossDomRecSys/blob/master/images/Approach.jpg)
The idea of this project is to define a Recommender System that takes knowledge from a source domian (movies) and apply to a target one (books).
In other words, the objective is to take advantage of the source domain data -this is a well known domain- to attack the cold-start problem in the target domain.
